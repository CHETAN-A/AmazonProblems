Array

An array will eventually either fill up or need to be
resized, an expensive operation that may not even 
be possible if memory is fragmented.

If many elements are removed memory may 
become wastefully empty or need to be made 
smaller.

Arrays allow random access to elements.

Searching becomes bit easier

Linked list

Elements can be inserted into linked lists 
indefinitely.

This is not a big issue in Linked list.

Linked lists allow only sequential access to
elements.

Searching consumes time when compared to Array
because it has to access sequentially
