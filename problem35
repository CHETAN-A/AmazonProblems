Actually this creates 50 bytes which may cause memory leak. therefore after printing p, we should free the variable p and q(i.e.. free(p),free(q)).

It may cause ExitFailure 9 which may arise due to memory exhaution

correct code:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
main()
{
char *p,*q;
p=(char *)malloc(25);
q=(char*) malloc(25);
strcpy(p,"amazon" );
strcpy(q,"hyd");
strcat(p,q);
printf("%s",p);
free(p);
free(q);
return 0;
}

Output:
amazonhyd
